# Cheminformatics
 A collection of various Cheminformatics/Bioinformatics projects to practice some coding techniques:
 1. Predicting the aqueous solubility for a range of compounds using ML
    - This is based on this kaggle workbook: https://www.kaggle.com/code/ewanwallace/predicting-aqueous-solubility#2.3-Model 
 2. Predicting the pIC50 for molecules binding to the ALK-5 receptor using a Neural Network
    - This is based on this paper: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7842961/
